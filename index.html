    <h1>Jakub Krucina</h1>

    <h2>Aspiring Junior Software Developer</h2>

    <p>I have spent most of my life around computers - mostly as a user - but I have
      taken my first steps into programming with Python, too.</p>

    <p>I now seek to enhance my knowledge and skills by taking the Junior Software
        Developer course, and further down the line, finally start a career in the IT
        industry.</p>

      <dt>RAM</dt>
      <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program

        accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time
        irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>
      <dt>Programming Language</dt>
      <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used
        to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions
        for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific
        algorithms.</dd>
